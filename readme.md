# Gesture Controlled Robotic Human Hand via Camera (OpenCV)

---
In this repository, a humanoid robotic hand capable of performing real-time movements of the human hand is operated with
an ordinary camera (a cell phone camera is used). Controlled with Arduino and OpenCV library was used. Google's MediaPipe machine learning solution
was used. The angle between the points on the hand is adjusted to coincide with the angle of the servo motors. Serial
communication between Arduino and computer is provided with Standard Firmata protocol.
